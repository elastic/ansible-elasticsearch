#Templates are a handler as they need to come after a restart e.g. suppose user removes security on a running node and doesn't
#specify es_api_basic_auth_username and es_api_basic_auth_password.  The templates will subsequently not be removed if we don't wait for the node to restart.
#Templates done after restart therefore - as a handler.
